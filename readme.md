bbcase
------

I wanted a 3D-printed case for my busblaster, and this is the result. I modeled the actual bus blaster (v4.1a) first (see: busblaster.scad) and created a case around that model.

The case bottom has grooves to fit the protruding pins. The case top has cutouts for the jumpers and main pin header. There is a little extra cutout in the header section, and angled edge to allow a viewing window to the silkscreened pin labels on the board itself. The top case has a hole to fit the USB port, and two viewing windows and reflectors for the power and act LEDs, to be viewed from the side.

I put an optional cutout above the FPGA to allow some heat to escape, that file is not included here, but is in the STL
